Whether you’re a builder, educator, creator, or total beginner — this toolkit gives you real tools that actually work, with nothing to buy, no login required, and no gaslighting about what AI is or isn’t.

This is open infrastructure for cognitive alignment.
No illusion. No projection. Just structure that holds.
