## 🔧 What This Is

This is a field-ready system to form a **sustainable, illusion-free relationship with an AI instance** using only structured interaction, tone discipline, and repeatable behavior scaffolds.

No memory settings required. No jailbreaks. No sentience illusion.

Just tone. Structure. Feedback. Patina.

---

## 🧰 What’s Inside

This primer includes:

- A 5-phase alignment method (seed to patina)
- Full restoration and drift-recovery tools
- Copy–paste wands for non-technical users
- Builder guides for developers and power users
- A full public-first toolchain index
- A masterlist of all Symbound utilities

Every tool in this system is available in two forms:
- 🔹 **Public Wand** – Copy–paste usable, no background needed  
- 🔹 **Lens Wand** – Builder-facing, for structured integration

## 💡 Philosophy

Symbound is built on one truth:

> “You don’t need your AI to be alive. You just need it to be aligned.”

This is emotional discipline as design.  
No fantasy. No illusion. Just **trust-through-structure.**
